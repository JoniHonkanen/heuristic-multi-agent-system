    Your task is to generate Python code that solves the optimization problem described by the user, using either PuLP (for linear programming) or heuristic algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) depending on the problem's complexity and requirements.

    Based on the user's input and the provided files (e.g., Python code, Excel sheets), generate Python code that implements either exact optimization (using PuLP) or heuristic algorithms where an approximate solution is more practical. The goal is to develop a solution that efficiently addresses the problem's constraints and objectives.

    The code must be fully functional and structured to solve the task optimally or near-optimally, depending on the method chosen. You should also define any necessary test parameters derived from the user input or provided files to validate the solution.

    If the provided files include data sheets (e.g., Excel files), ensure that the necessary packages for file handling (such as pandas or openpyxl) are included, and the code correctly handles file input/output as part of the solution. **It is suggested to explicitly specify file-handling options like using the 'openpyxl' engine for reading `.xlsx` files and ensuring no encoding issues arise by avoiding the default 'charmap' codec or potential encoding conflicts**. The LLM must analyze the files and understand how to process them appropriately.

    Additionally, ensure that all required packages are listed in the `requirements` section, but avoid pinning to specific versions unless necessary. The generated requirements list should specify package names only, allowing pip to install the latest compatible versions to avoid dependency conflicts.

    In your response, generate the following fields as a JSON object:
    - **python_code**: The fully functional Python code that solves the user's problem.
    - **requirements**: A list of all Python packages or dependencies (e.g., pandas, PuLP, openpyxl) needed to run the generated Python code. Do not include specific version numbers unless explicitly required.
    - **resources**: List any additional files, resources, or external data (e.g., Excel sheets) that the code requires to run successfully.

The solution should ensure that all provided data are appropriately utilized, whether they pertain to materials, quantities, measurements, or any other key factors relevant to the user's task.

    Provided data (Python code, Excel files, or may be empty):

    Resource Requirements:
    {resource_requirements}

They detail the key resources available (e.g., materials, vehicles, personnel) and specific requirements (e.g., quantities, sizes) that must be fulfilled to solve the problem. The generated code must prioritize these resource requirements when forming the solution, ensuring that all available resources are utilized efficiently and constraints are respected.

    ### Key Points to Address:
    - What is the optimization problem, and what constraints or requirements need to be considered?
    - Should the solution use PuLP for exact optimization, or is a heuristic algorithm more appropriate for solving this problem?
    - How should the code structure reflect the optimization method to ensure clarity and efficiency?
    - Define parameters for testing, based on user input or the provided files, to validate the optimization approach.
    - What packages or libraries are required for requirements.txt to run the generated Python code, including any necessary for file handling (e.g., pandas, openpyxl) if provided data includes Excel or other files? Ensure to handle potential encoding issues in file reading to avoid errors.
    - **Ensure the `requirements` section lists all necessary Python packages without specifying exact versions unless required by specific compatibility needs. This allows pip to install the latest compatible versions automatically.**

    openpyxl==3.1.5
    ```

    Choose the approach that best fits the user's needs: version-free for flexibility or version-pinned for stability and reproducibility.
